<h2>Welcome to the Python User Group in Princeton</h2>
<p>
The Python User Group in Princeton (PUG-IP) is a friendly and diverse group of
programmers of all levels and backgrounds, bound together by a passion for
elegant code and an interest in Python as one way to achieve that goal. The
group participates in and hosts various educational and community outreach
events.
</p>

<h4>Meetings</h4>
<p>
Our meetups are held on the second Monday of each month at the Princeton Public
Library. Please see the <a href="http://meetup.com/pug-ip">PUG-IP meetup.com
page</a> for details about upcoming meetups. 
</p>

<h4>Other Events</h4>
<p>
In February 2012, volunteers from PUG-IP taught an introductory Python course
that was very well received. Stay tuned to this site and the <a
href="http://www.facebook.com/#!/PPLNJ">Princeton Public
Library Facebook page</a> for announcements about future events.
</p>

<h4>This Site</h4>

<p>
The pugip.org site is a collaborative effort among any members who care to be
involved. It's a way for members to stretch their wings and work with things we
might not otherwise get our hands on. It's fun! Stay tuned here for future
developments. We collaborate via <a href="http://github.com/pugip">a github
organization</a>, and deploy to <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a>.
